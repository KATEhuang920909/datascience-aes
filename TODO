* Play with tf-idf stuff
  * Stop words good or bad?
  * do bi-grams help? trigrams?
  * PCA -> is it necessary? Are there better sizes (eg, try 10, 20, 30, ... 100?)
* Try to normalize the ner_XXX and pos_XXX vectors by num_words.
* Try alternate functional forms, eg num_chars^2, log(num_chars), num_chars^(1/2)
* Better spelling checker
* Presence of Keywords in prompt (compare tf-idf of prompt X among prompts with tf-idf of that essay or something???0
* Check for presence of verbs in all sentences?
* try turning things into flags?
